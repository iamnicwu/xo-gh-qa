    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


I wanted to follow up regarding your new online storefront. I’d like to set up a quick call to help get your Storefront up and running and go through the tools and resources you can now use to manage your leads.

To easily schedule a call at your convenience, I&apos;ve included my personal calendar link: a link to my calendar. Please pick the date/time that works best for you.

Talk soon!


Tell me how I’m doing!</textOnly>
