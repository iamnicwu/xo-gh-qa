    <subject>Payments Past Due for The Knot Services – Prompt Attention Appreciated {!Account.Name}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your partnership with The Knot. I am reaching out to notify you that our records show you are currently {!Account.Days_Since_Past_Due__c} days past due, leaving an outstanding balance of {!Account.Past_Due_Balance__c}. Often times we find this may be an oversight and are happy to help remedy this right away.

If you would like to discuss payment plan options or have any questions, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can get this remedied right away. I am available from 8:15am-5:00pm CST, Monday-Friday.

If you are paying by Credit Card or ACH, I have attached a payment authorization form that you can complete and fax back to me if you prefer. For your security do not email this form.

Please contact me and I’m happy to get this resolved right away!

Very Truly,
{!Account.CBBS__c}
